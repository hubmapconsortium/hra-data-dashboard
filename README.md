# CCF-HRA Data Dashboard

Simple dashboards for HuBMAP Data that have CCF-HRA "rui locations". See <https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/> for more information.

## Access to my data

To access your data, grab your API key and set it using `localStorage.setItem('HUBMAP_KEY', 'my-key-goes-here')` from the developer console and refresh. Note that keys expire and may cause the query to fail after a while. In that case, simply update the key above or delete it via the developer console.
